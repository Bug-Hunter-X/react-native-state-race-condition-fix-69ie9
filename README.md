## React Native State Update Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development: a race condition caused by accessing and modifying state within a rapidly called function. The issue arises because state updates are asynchronous; changes might not be immediately reflected, leading to unexpected behavior when the function executes again before the state update completes.

The `Bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  `BugSolution.js` offers a solution to mitigate the race condition, ensuring the correct state value is always used.

This example focuses on illustrating the race condition and effective solutions.  The problem might manifest differently in various applications but the core issue and solutions will remain largely similar.
