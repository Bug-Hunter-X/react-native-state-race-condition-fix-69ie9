This error occurs when you are using a state variable inside a function that is called multiple times in a short period. React Native may not have enough time to update the state variable between function calls, resulting in unexpected behavior. This issue occurs because the state update is asynchronous in nature. By the time the state update is reflected in the UI, the function might have already been called multiple times leading to an unexpected race condition.
