The solution involves using the functional update pattern or preventing the function from calling itself multiple times within a short interval. This is accomplished by using `useState` with a callback function to ensure that the state is updated based on the previous value or using debounce technique or lodash throttle to control the frequency of the function execution.
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
export default MyComponent; 
```
